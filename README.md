# Advanced Python: Working With Data
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Advanced Python: Working With Data. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

One of the most popular, fastest growing disciplines in the world of technology today is data science, and the Python programming language is at the center of it all. Whether you need to work with large sets of data or just process some spreadsheet files, Python has you covered.

In this course, Joe Marini demonstrates some of the built-in features that make Python a great language to use when working with data-intensive applications, working with a real live data set provided by the United States Geological Survey that tracks earthquake information around the world.

You will see how to perform common data operations like sorting and filtering, determining basic information like minimum and maximum values, and how to read and write data to and from other formats like CSV files used by spreadsheets and JSON for interchange with other systems and programs.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all of the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for local machine setup. 

## Instructor
Joe Marini has been building software for some of the biggest and best known companies in Silicon Valley over the course of a 30+ year career, such as Adobe, Microsoft, and Google.
